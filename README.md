# Studentadministrasjonssystem

Ah, yes, this (in hindsight) good task was a mess.
I stopped woring on my projects to help someone
else with this exact task. I started then realiced
it most likely is meant to be hard-coded, so my
adventure started here.

## A Hard choice

So I started of not knowing what this task was implying.
My mind was racing to find you how can
I (relatively new to C#) use all I've learned the past
week or so to have list in list and remember which
grade for each subject for each student. I knew
from then on that if I were to do that it would't
be aroundt 100 lines of code but hundres just to
have a half woring system. So I yielded and
randomized the characters and made it so,
you can't really make your own student,
other to code them in. you can also code
in studieprograms with different subjects,
but can't add them in program.

One of my disappointments to my own abilities so far.
